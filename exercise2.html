        <h1>Crocodile</h1>
        <p>Crocodiles (family Crocodylidae) or true crocodiles are large semiaquatic reptiles that live throughout the tropics in Africa, 
            Asia, the Americas and Australia. The term crocodile is sometimes used even more loosely to include all extant members of 
            the order Crocodilia, which includes the alligators and caimans (family Alligatoridae), the gharial and false gharial 
            (family Gavialidae) among other extinct taxa.</p>

        <p>Although they appear similar, crocodiles, alligators and the gharial belong to separate biological families. 
            The gharial, with its narrow snout, is easier to distinguish, while morphological differences are more difficult to spot 
            in crocodiles and alligators. The most obvious external differences are visible in the head, with crocodiles having narrower 
            and longer heads, with a more V-shaped than a U-shaped snout compared to alligators and caimans. Another obvious trait is that 
            the upper and lower jaws of the crocodiles are the same width, and the teeth in the lower jaw fall along the edge or outside the 
            upper jaw when the mouth is closed; therefore, all teeth are visible, unlike an alligator, which possesses in the upper jaw small 
            depressions into which the lower teeth fit. Also, when the crocodile's mouth is closed, the large fourth tooth in the lower jaw fits 
            into a constriction in the upper jaw. For hard-to-distinguish specimens, the protruding tooth is the most reliable feature to define 
            the species' family.[1] Crocodiles have more webbing on the toes of the hind feet and can better tolerate saltwater due to specialized 
            salt glands for filtering out salt, which are present, but non-functioning, in alligators. Another trait that separates crocodiles 
            from other crocodilians is their much higher levels of aggression.</p>
